The suitability standards discussed below represent minimum suitability standards for prospective investors. The satisfaction of such standards by a prospective investor does not necessarily mean that the Managed FOREX Trading Program is a suitable investment for such prospective investor. Prospective investors are encouraged to consult their personal financial advisors to determine whether an investment in the Managed FOREX Trading Program is appropriate. We will require each investor to represent in writing that, among other things, (i) by reason of the investor‚Äôs business or financial experience, or that of the investor‚Äôs professional advisor, the investor is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an investment in the Managed FOREX Trading Program and of protecting its own interests in connection with the transaction; (ii) the investor is investing for its own account and for investment only; (iii) such investor meets the suitability requirements set forth below.'] },

In determining income, an investor should add to his or her adjusted gross income any amounts attributable to tax-exempt income received, losses claimed as a limited partner in any limited partnership, deductions claimed for depreciation, contributions to an IRA or Keogh retirement plan, alimony payments and any amount by which from long-term capital gains has been reduced in arriving at adjusted gross income.', 'Prospective investors will be required to represent in writing that they meet the suitability standards set forth above, which represent minimum suitability requirements for prospective investors.
